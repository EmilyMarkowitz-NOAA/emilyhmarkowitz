    Thesis: “Distribution Shifts Associated with Changing Environmental Parameters in Two Demersal Species: Summer Flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) & Black Sea Bass (Centropristis striata) on the NE US shelf”

    - Developed environmental preference and habitat suitability models from the NOAA NEFSC survey dataset and Regional Oceanographic Modeling System (ROMS) output in MATLAB and R.
    - Incorporated results into survey abundance estimates and stock assessments. 
    - Also mentored a summer high school lab intern assessing Black Sea Bass (Centropristis striata) winter survival on the NE US shelf using MATLAB.
    - Assisted peers with field work in Great South Bay, Long Island, NY to survey fish and crustaceans.
    - Assisted peers with laboratory experiments at Flax Pond Marine Laboratory studying blue crab temperature-dependent aerobic and anaerobic metabolism.
    - Assisted peers tagging horse shoe crabs with acoustic and NYDEC button tags.
    - Assisted peers with capturing herring gulls for blood-contaminate and -microbiological sampling and GPS tagging in Jamaica Bay, Queens and Stony Brook Harbor, NY.
