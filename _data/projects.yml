    NMFS has provided this Web Calculator as an optional tool to provide estimated effect distances (i.e., isopleths) where PTS onset thresholds may be exceeded. Results provided by this calculator do not represent the entirety of the comprehensive effects analysis, but rather serve as one tool to help evaluate the effects of a proposed action on marine mammal hearing and make findings required by NOAA's various statutes. Input values are the responsibility of the individual user.
