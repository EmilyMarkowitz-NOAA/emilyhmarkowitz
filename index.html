                        During the 2018 Knauss Fellowship I interacted with scientists and policy makers who addressed global issues concerning the governance of our coasts and oceans. My fellowship was in NMFS Office of Science and Technology Assessment and Monitoring Division’s Protected Species Science. This position offered revelatory exposure to the world of protected species and highlighted the connections between that world and my work in commercial fisheries. The fellowship granted me with many responsibilities, including lead coordinator, technical support resource, newsletter editor, and as an RShiny application developer. These responsibilities gave me the opportunity to work with people not only in and across NOAA, but also with researchers at fisheries science centers and external collaborators in other federal agencies and academia.

                        I currently support the NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology’s Socioeconomics group as a contractor where I manage the redevelopment and production of the Fisheries Economics of the US report. This is a national-level report that provides ten years of economic information, impacts, and analyses related to U.S. commercial and recreational fishing activities and fishing-related industries. In my role, I manage the contributors and their corresponding input and datasets. Additionally, I am working to contemporize this iconic report by writing reproducible code using R and RMarkdown, which produces several report outputs and JavaScript files for the interactive FEUS online tool. Next, I will develop RShiny applications to make economic impact analyses more accessible to scientists and collaborators around the country. All of this work has gone into improving this nationally regarded report for the many who reference it and making the process of producing it more streamlined, reproducible, and efficient.

                My master’s research in Dr. Janet Nye’s quantitative fisheries ecology lab tackled big picture questions of socio-political relevance. My thesis used NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center fisheries-independent bottom trawl survey data and forecasted regional oceanographic model system data to determine the environmental preferences and suitable habitat of migratory demersal fish at different life stages. I used these models to develop an adjustment for availability of these fish to the survey and inform fisheries management decisions as climate continues to change along the Northeast US coastline.

                        <h3>Modeling Environmentally Driven Distribution Shifts in Regional Ocean Model Systems for Two Demersal, Migratory, Commercially Important Species</h3>
                        <p>
                            Shifts in fish population distributions are a growing concern for fishermen and fisheries management scientists. Habitat suitability models (HSMs) of summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) and black sea bass (Centropristis striata) were created using the fishery-independent Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) bottom trawl survey data in generalized additive models and cumulative distribution functions. These analyses were used to probabilistically link where different length classes of these fish would likely be across different environmental variables in spring and fall. These different environmental variables (surface and bottom temperature and salinity, depth, and bottom type) have similar influences on life history of these two demersal, migratory, and commercially important species. Then, the HSMs were used to illustrate how the population’s distribution changed over time by hindcasting over regional ocean modeling systems (ROMS). The ROMS used in this analysis was a 1 Day Averaged ROMS for the Northeast US Coastline from 1958-2007. This hindcast will help further correct available catchability estimates in such a way that impacts estimates of stratified-mean biomass and abundance.
